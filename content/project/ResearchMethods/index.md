This course offers an introduction to research methods. The principal aim of the course is to familiarize students with the main quantitative and qualitative methodological tools used in political science. The course teaches how to write a research question, analyze previous research in a given field, how to move from conceptual definition of a political phenomenon to its measurable operational definition, how to write a hypothesis and how to analyze data and test a given hypothesis. By the end of the course, the students will be able to operationalize their own theoretical constructs and collect and analyze their own data in a research paper. The course also teaches various aspects of programming in StataÂ®. The students can transfer their acquired skills for their careers and have competitive advantage in governmental agencies, think tanks, NGOs and private sector. There are no mathematical prerequisites for the course other than high-school level basic algebra.
