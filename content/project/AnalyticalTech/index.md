The central aim of the science of politics is to identify general patterns among abstract concepts (such as democracy and wealth or EU membership and human rights violations). Political scientists think about the world politics, theorize about the processes that create the political world we today live in and compare their opinions against solid evidence and enlighten the policy-making processes. In doing so, we are interested in a tool that disciplines consistency of our thinking and conceptualization as well as meaningful test of our hypotheses. To this end, there are very powerful analytical methods that will deliver us these very qualities. This course is an overview of the underpinnings of these methods and it consists of four main parts:

-A short refresher for the analytical tools we will use throughout the seme--ster (basic algebra, logic, sets and functions).
-Graph and Quantitative Data Literacy i.e. how do we tell if China has become more powerful than the US? Or how do we talk about prevalence of suicide-attacks in a particular region?
-Understanding chance and uncertainty in political world - the Fundamentals of Probability.
-Understanding how actors (political entities i.e. states, terrorist groups) act strategically - the Fundamentals of Decision and Game Theory.
